# "Tic-Tac-Toe"
I developed this interactive Tic-Tac-Toe game using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The game allows two players to compete, taking turns to mark spaces on a 3x3 grid. The goal is to align three symbols (either X or O) horizontally, vertically, or diagonally before the opponent does.
Key Features:
  1: Simple and intuitive UI: Clean design with smooth gameplay.
  2: Two-player mode: Play against a friend locally.
  3: Reset Functionality: Allows players to reset the game and start over easily.
  4: Real-time Win Detection: The game detects winning combinations and displays the result instantly.
